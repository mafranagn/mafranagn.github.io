When their time has passed,<br>
Would I regret the same way as they did?<br>
<br>
Would I lay an altar with their images?<br>
<br>
Would I litter it with offerings<br>
of the first piece of every food and every drink<br>
to make up for the lost time resenting<br>
their inadequacies.<br>
<br>
And as I get older,<br>
Will this resentment slowly fade away<br>
as this truth starts to settle that<br>
they tried to be the best that they can be,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With their potential sealed off<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;by a ceiling forged by a transient life time<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and an incessantly out-dated upbringing.<br>
<br>
And as I get older,<br>
will I be able to find forgiveness well before their time?<br>
<br>
And do you think that<br>
they’ll be able to forgive me<br>
for everything I’ve said and done in my resentment?
