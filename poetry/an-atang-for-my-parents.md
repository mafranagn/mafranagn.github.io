When their time has passed,
Would I regret the same way as they did?

Would I lay an altar with their images?

Would I litter it with offerings
of the first piece of every food and every drink
to make up for the lost time resenting
their inadequacies.

And as I get older,
Will this resentment slowly fade away
as this truth starts to settle that
they tried to be the best that they can be,
With their potential sealed off
by a ceiling forged by a transient life time
and an incessantly out-dated upbringing.

And as I get older,
will I be able to find forgiveness well before their time?

And do you think that
they’ll be able to forgive me
for everything I’ve said and done in my resentment?
