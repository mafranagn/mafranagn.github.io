A rain-kissed street
on a blue night with a silence so destitute and deafening.
Constellations both man-made and natural lay
supine on brief puddles scattered about.
Hazy patterns of traffic lights waltzing around for blocks on end,
and
maybe
if you choose to waltz with them,
youâ€™ll see how vibrant this lonely night can be.
