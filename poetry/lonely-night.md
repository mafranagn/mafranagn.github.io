A rain-kissed street<br>
on a blue night with a silence so destitute and deafening.<br>
Constellations both man-made and natural lay<br>
supine on brief puddles scattered about.<br>
Hazy patterns of traffic lights waltzing around for blocks on end,<br>
and<br>
maybe<br>
if you choose to waltz with them,<br>
youâ€™ll see how vibrant this lonely night can be.
