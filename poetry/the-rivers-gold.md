In search for a break (or a breath) from this world,<br>
I found myself standing eye to eye with a river<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;holding water that continuously flowed<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;from the heavens to reality,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with its stories and its being etched and stored in its banks.<br>
<br>
If only I could live purely on wealth like that.<br>
<br>
I’d like to imagine that this river greeted me:<br>
<i>“Welcome back”</i> it would say,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As if it has met me in multiple lifetimes,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;all the while enjoying its boundless one.<br>
Then<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It would tease me with its incomprehensible<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;murmurs and babbles of stories from my past lives.<br>
And in my imagination, in at least one of them,<br>
I was able to be someone that I feel like I cannot be in this one.<br>
<br>
but I found myself only standing eye to eye with this river<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;holding secrets I can only dream to be true.
