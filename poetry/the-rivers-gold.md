In search for a break (or a breath) from this world,
I found myself standing eye to eye with a river
holding water that continuously flowed
from the heavens to reality,
with its stories and its being etched and stored in its banks.

If only I could live purely on wealth like that.

I’d like to imagine that this river greeted me:
“Welcome back” it would say,
As if it has met me in multiple lifetimes,
all the while enjoying its boundless one.
Then
It would tease me with its incomprehensible
murmurs and babbles of stories from my past lives.
And in my imagination, in at least one of them,
I was able to be someone that I feel like I cannot be in this one.

but I found myself only standing eye to eye with this river
holding secrets I can only dream to be true.
