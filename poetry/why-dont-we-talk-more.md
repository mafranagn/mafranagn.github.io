Is it so weird
to just walk up to someone and say

“HEY STRANGER!
I quite like your vibe
with your wacky cactus socks
a book in hand and a
vintage, thrifted sweater.
You look like you were written by a female author
and that’s a great thing.”

Yes, it is quite weird.
I know.
But you know what I mean…

Strangers don’t approach strangers anymore
and so I let this one pass
with another friendship that could’ve been.
