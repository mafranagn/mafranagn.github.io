Is it so weird<br>
to just walk up to someone and say<br>
<br>
“<i>HEY STRANGER!</i><br>
I quite like your vibe<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with your wacky cactus socks<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a book in hand and a<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;vintage, thrifted sweater.<br>
You look like you were written by a female author<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and that’s a great thing.”<br>
<br>
Yes, it is quite weird.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know.<br>
But you know what I mean…<br>
<br>
Strangers don’t approach strangers anymore<br>
and so I let this one pass<br>
with another friendship that could’ve been.
